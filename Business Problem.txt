Business Understanding

Nowadays, one of the most important challenges for governments in general and governments of the big cities in particular, is to prevent car collisions. 

This project aims at predicting the severity of car collisions for the Seattle Police Department (SPD) based on different factors, such as weather, road and light conditions as well as the number of peoples and vehicles involved.

A model predicting the probability and severity of collisions can be very helpful to remind drivers to be more careful in some critical situations and to help the law enforcement in Seattle to prevent car accidents.
